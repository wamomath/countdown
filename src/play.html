                    Welcome to the WAMT Countdown Round! Twelve students will
                    compete in a single-elimination bracket. Players are seeded
                    based on their written round rankings. The top four written
                    round scorers will receive a bye in the first round, meaning
                    that they automatically move to the second round. The
                    remaining competitors will face off in the first round, with
                    5th against 12th, 6th against 11th, and so on. Questions
                    will be read aloud by the moderator and displayed on both
                    contestants' screens and the large screen up front. Either
                    student may buzz in at any time, even before the moderator
                    finishes reading. After buzzing in, the student will have 3
                    seconds to begin their answer or lose their chance to answer
                    that question. If the student answers incorrectly, the other
                    contestant will have the remainder of the question read to
                    them and will have the remainder of the time limit to
                    answer.<br />
                    The first student to answer three questions correctly wins
                    the match and advances to the next round. Players have 45
                    seconds to answer each question, including the time the
                    moderator spends reading the question. If no one buzzes
                    within that time, nobody gets the point. In the event of a
                    2â€“2 tie, the match will proceed to sudden victory, where the
                    next person to answer a question will win the match. Matches
                    will continue until a final champion is determined.<br />
                    Judges will determine the correctness of all answers. Please
                    remain silent during matches to avoid disturbing the
                    contestants.
